## Musicon (Handlebars Project) 

### Description

I decided to complete this Codecademy Handlebars project in my code editor rather than the online portal to get a more holistic understanding of the file structure. This also solidifies the topic concept in my mind. I used the supplied source code and completed the steps using Github version control to commit documentation. Here is the project description:

In this project, I will be updating the website of an online musical instruments store, Musicon. I will incorporate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars to make a stylish multi-page interactive website.

Musicon will have three separate web pages: a home page, a store page, and a contacts page. The home and store pages already have most of the HTML and CSS set up. Your job is to make the following changes:

* Create a navigation bar using unordered lists, anchor tags, and class attributes.
* Style the website using your knowledge of display, positioning, color, and font declarations.
* Build out semantic templates using a client-side templating engine: https://handlebarsjs.com/
* Display relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers.
